# Website Development & Maintenance Log  
**Maintainer:** Hopotta  
**Date:** December 24, 2024  
**Version:** 1.0  

## 1. Major Update: Initial Website Creation  
- **Designed and implemented the main website structure**, including:  
  - `index.html` as the homepage.  
  - `posts/` directory for blog content.  
  - Individual post pages (`posts1.html`, etc.).  
- **Established core website layout**, ensuring consistency across all pages.  
- **Introduced a navigation bar for easy section switching**, including:  
  - `Posts` (default section).  
  - `CodeSpace` (future section for programming-related content).  
  - `Paradox` (future section for theoretical discussions).  
- **Applied inline CSS styling within `index.html`**, avoiding external `.css` files for simpler customization.  
- **Ensured a responsive and mobile-friendly design** using `flexbox`.  
- **Files Created & Modified:**  
  - `index.html` (main page).  
  - `posts/posts1.html` (sample blog post).  
  - `posts/posts_template.html` (template for future posts).  

## 2. Navigation Bar Implementation  
- **Positioned site title (`Hopotta’s Log`) on the left side of the header.**  
- **Aligned navigation links (`Posts`, `CodeSpace`, `Paradox`) on the right** while maintaining balance.  
- **Ensured navigation bar remains responsive**, preventing layout overflow on small screens.  
- **Adjusted font size of `Hopotta’s Log` to fit better within the header.**  
- **Files Modified:**  
  - `index.html`  

## 3. Post System and Dynamic Post Display  
- **Implemented a structured `post-card` layout** on the `index.html` homepage:  
  - Displays blog post title, date, estimated reading time, and author.  
  - Extracts the first two lines from each post’s content before truncating with `...`.  
- **Created `postsx.html` template** to streamline future blog post additions.  
- **Ensured post width consistency across `index.html` and individual post pages.**  
- **Files Modified & Created:**  
  - `index.html`  
  - `posts/posts1.html`  
  - `posts/posts_template.html`  

## 4. Mobile Responsiveness and Layout Fixes  
- **Adjusted header alignment to prevent text overflow on mobile devices.**  
- **Modified `post-card` alignment** to match `Hopotta’s Log` for a cleaner layout.  
- **Refined spacing between post cards** to avoid excessive gaps or crowding.  
- **Files Modified:**  
  - `index.html`  

## 5. Footer Positioning Fix  
- **Ensured footer is correctly positioned below content**, rather than sticking to the bottom of the viewport.  
- **Applied `margin-top: auto` to naturally push footer down when content is short.**  
- **Files Modified:**  
  - `index.html`  

## 6. Standardized Post Page Layout (`posts1.html`)  
- **Maintained consistent header and navigation structure across all pages.**  
- **Aligned post content width with `post-card` size from `index.html`.**  
- **Displayed metadata (date, estimated reading time, author) below the title.**  
- **Ensured smooth navigation back to the homepage.**  
- **Files Modified:**  
  - `posts/posts1.html`  

## Next Steps  
- Conduct cross-device testing to verify responsiveness and layout consistency.  
- Implement a system to automatically update `index.html` when new posts are added.  
- Develop `CodeSpace` and `Paradox` sections with meaningful content.  
- Improve post pagination for handling a larger number of posts.
