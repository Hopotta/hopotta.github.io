        <p class="introduction">
          Despite the growing recognition of the environmental impact of air travel, many academics continue to fly frequently, 
          particularly for attending conferences, based on a recent study.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          A recent research [1] has revealed a paradox in the behavior of academics at a top-tier research university. 
          Despite the widespread acknowledgment among respondents that air travel exacerbates climate change, many—especially professors and PhD students—continue to frequently fly to attend conferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Air travel is one of the most emission-intensive activities humans partake in. 
          A 2021 study [2] reported that aviation accounts for about 4% of human-induced global warming. 
          A separate analysis from 2013 found that the top 10% of frequent flyers were responsible for 45% of the aviation sector's greenhouse gas emissions. 
          Researchers argue that institutions and conference organizers should consider alternative solutions to help reduce the academic sector's carbon footprint.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We fly frequently, yet we claim we shouldn't," said Jonas De Vos, a transport geographer at University College London and the lead author of this latest study. 
          "We are hypocritical." De Vos and his team distributed a survey via social media and university newsletters to gather data on travel habits from the entire university community. 
          Respondents were asked to fill out a questionnaire about their travel behavior and rate their agreement with 17 statements related to conference attendance. 
          The team analyzed responses from 1,116 participants, including PhD students and those involved in research and/or teaching, classifying them based on their attitudes towards academic travel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over 80% of respondents agreed that air travel is harmful to the environment. However, in 2022, more than 35% of respondents had flown to attend at least one conference. 
          The largest group identified as "reluctant flyers," consisting of 294 respondents. Although they preferred travelling by train, they often flew to attend conferences. 
          The study also found that professors and PhD students favored in-person conferences and frequently traveled abroad. 
          Meanwhile, teaching and research staff traveled less frequently and often opted for train travel to nearby regions, a trend observed particularly among female respondents.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is the first study to so clearly highlight the discrepancy between what people say and what they do," commented Sebastian Jäckle, a political scientist at the University of Freiburg, 
          who once cycled to a conference in Poland. He suggested that similar surveys should be conducted at more universities to obtain a representative sample.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the survey did not ask respondents why they chose to fly, De Vos believes that researchers fear missing out on opportunities to showcase their work and build networks with potential collaborators. 
          "International networking remains crucial for career advancement and securing research funding," he explained. Despite the increasing awareness of aviation's environmental impact, 
          in-person international conferences still rely heavily on fossil fuels. 
          For instance, at the 2017 annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, over 20,000 scientists gathered in Chicago, generating 39,500 tons of CO₂ emissions from flights alone [3].
        </p>
        <p>
          The evidence on whether flying to conferences significantly boosts academic success remains mixed. A survey conducted in France involving 6,000 scientists [4] found a positive correlation between air travel and the h-index, 
          a measure of academic impact. This suggests that travel might help early-career researchers gain visibility and allow senior researchers to maintain it. Conversely, 
          a survey by the University of British Columbia involving 705 academics [5] found no causal link between air travel and academic achievement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even scientists advocating for reduced air travel acknowledge the benefits of in-person meetings, with few calling for an outright ban on flying. 
          Susann Görlinger, co-founder of the Zurich-based nonprofit iilo, which aims to help organizations reduce flight emissions, suggested that institutions implement carbon budgets and share these with researchers as needed. 
          "Those still in the early stages of their careers could have slightly larger budgets than their more established counterparts," she noted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Görlinger also recommended that conference organizers offer more options, such as high-quality virtual and hybrid meetings, and multi-hub conferences held in major cities accessible by train. 
          These alternatives could also increase opportunities for researchers with limited funding or family responsibilities to engage in networking.
        </p>
        <p>
          While individuals can make more environmentally conscious travel decisions, a broader cultural shift within academia is necessary to reduce the sector’s carbon footprint, according to Jäckle. 
          "As long as CVs continue to require evidence of international conference participation for faculty positions, there's only so much individuals can do," he concluded.
