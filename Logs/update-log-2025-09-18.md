# Website Maintenance Log  
**Maintainer:** Hopotta  
**Date:** September 18, 2025  
**Version:** 1.4  

## 1. Glassmorphism Header Refinements  
- **Enhanced liquid glass effect** with more realistic convex edges and refraction-like highlights, inspired by external liquid glass project code.  
- **Fixed header height responsiveness** to prevent it from becoming too compressed on small screens, ensuring consistent appearance across devices.  
- **Adjusted font sizing within the header** so that ‚ÄúHopotta‚Äôs Log‚Äù is readable but smaller than post titles, maintaining proper typographic hierarchy.  
- **Resolved text clipping issues** (e.g., ‚Äúg‚Äù descender being cut off) by improving line-height and padding.  

## 2. Responsive Typography Adjustments  
- **Resized post titles** (`.article-title`) to ensure they are always larger and more prominent than the header title.  
- **Tweaked index page main heading** (‚ÄúüëãWelcome To Hopotta‚Äôs Log!‚Äù) to be smaller than before, avoiding dominance over post titles.  
- **Reduced post-card titles (`h2`)** in index layout for a subtler appearance, especially on narrow screens.  

## 3. Layout Consistency Across Pages  
- **Unified responsive padding rules** using `clamp()` to balance readability on both mobile and desktop.  
- **Adjusted article container width** to avoid excessive central concentration on wide screens while ensuring it doesn‚Äôt overflow beyond the header.  
- **Standardized post list layout** on index page: each post card now appears on its own line, rather than multiple per row, restoring the blog-like vertical structure.  

## 4. Mobile Readability Enhancements  
- **Improved spacing and margins** on narrow screens to prevent words from being squeezed into very short lines.  
- **Adjusted font scaling** so that body text remains comfortable to read on both mobile and desktop.  
- **Ensured navigation items in the header remain on one line** by adjusting font sizes and spacing for small screens.  

## 5. Structural and Usability Updates  
- **Extracted styles into `site1.css`** for posts pages to unify layout and ease future maintenance.  
- **Configured correct relative paths (`../assets/css/site1.css`)** so styles load properly in both Live Server and GitHub Pages.  
- **Added favicon support** so the site now displays its icon in browser tabs.

## Next Steps  
- Conduct testing on different devices and browsers to verify the CodeSpace interface.  
- Plan for additional interactive code projects in `codespace/`.  
- Plan for designing interfaces of 'Paradox'.  
- Consider extracting the footer into a shared component (`footer.html`) for consistent branding.  
- Add `<noscript>` fallback content to warn users if dynamic navbar fails to load.  
- Explore using templating engines (like Jekyll or 11ty) if site complexity increases.
