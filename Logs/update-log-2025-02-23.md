# Website Maintenance Log - February 23, 2025  
**Maintainer:** Hopotta  
**Version:** 1.1

## 1. Major Update: CodeSpace Page Completion  
- **Implemented and populated the `codespace/` interface.**  
- **Completed the `code1` page** with functional content.  
- **Used Minesweeper v1.0 as the primary content** for `code1.html`.  
- **Ensured navigation and layout consistency** between `codespace/` and `code1.html`.  

## 2. Navigation Bar Fixes  
- **Issue:** The "Posts" link in `codespace/code1.html` incorrectly redirected to `hopotta.github.io/posts/`.  
- **Fix:** Updated the `<nav>` link for "Posts" from `../index.html` to `/index.html`, ensuring it redirects correctly.  
- **Files Modified:**  
  - `codespace/code1.html`  

## 3. Minesweeper v1.0 Integration  
- **Added Minesweeper v1.0 as the main content in `codespace/code1.html`**, including:  
  - Game logic and UI implementation  
  - Timer and mine placement functionality  
  - Board rendering with dynamic updates  
- **Ensured correct styling and interaction for a smooth user experience.**  

## 4. Code Formatting and UI Improvements  
- **Fixed `pre.code-snippet` font rendering issue** by enforcing `Consolas` font with `!important`.  
- **Added a language label to code blocks** using the `::before` pseudo-element.  
- **Updated Minesweeper explanation text** under `<p class="introduction">` for better readability.  

## Next Steps  
- Conduct testing on different devices and browsers to verify the CodeSpace interface.  
- Plan for additional interactive code projects in `codespace/`.
- Plan for designing interfaces of 'Paradox'
