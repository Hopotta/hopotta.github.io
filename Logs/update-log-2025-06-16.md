# Website Maintenance Log  
**Maintainer:** Hopotta  
**Date:** June 16, 2025  
**Version:** 1.3  

## 1. Enhanced Glassmorphism Header Design  
- **Implemented advanced liquid glass effect** on the header with improved backdrop blur and layered inset shadows.  
- **Added pseudo-element highlights (`::after`)** to create realistic convex glass edges and subtle liquid light reflections.  
- **Adjusted transparency and saturation** for a more elegant and modern frosted glass appearance.  
- **Set fixed width with rounded corners** for a cleaner, balanced layout that stands out without overwhelming the page.  

## 2. Responsive and Readable Typography  
- **Refined header font colors** to improve contrast and ensure readability against translucent backgrounds.  
- **Tweaked hover styles** for navigation links to enhance user interaction feedback while maintaining the glass aesthetic.  

## 3. Layout and Positioning Improvements  
- **Centered the header horizontally with transform** to accommodate various screen sizes while maintaining consistent spacing.  
- **Set maximum width of 1200px for header** to slightly exceed main content width for better visual hierarchy.  
- **Added padding and margin adjustments** to prevent overflow and ensure alignment with page content.  

## Next Steps  
- Conduct testing on different devices and browsers to verify the CodeSpace interface.  
- Plan for additional interactive code projects in `codespace/`.  
- Plan for designing interfaces of 'Paradox'.  
- Consider extracting the footer into a shared component (`footer.html`) for consistent branding.  
- Add `<noscript>` fallback content to warn users if dynamic navbar fails to load.  
- Explore using templating engines (like Jekyll or 11ty) if site complexity increases.
