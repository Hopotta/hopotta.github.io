# Website Maintenance Log  
**Maintainer:** Hopotta  
**Date:** December 20, 2025  
**Version:** 1.5.2  

## 1. Header Style Update  
- **From rounded rectangle to rectangle**: considering rounded one may not include areas beyond it, altered into `top: 0`.
- Adapted a brandnew `.container` to include the header.
- Adjusted related parametres to adapt to user experience and reduce code redundancy.

## 2. Adjusted `fontfamily` 
- **Improved font experience**: adjust font in `perspective` articles.  
- Adapted 'Crimson Pro' instead of formerly first choice Helvetica or Calibri from fonts.googleapis.com.  

## 3. Deleted CodeSpace Section
- **Added a `perspective` section as substitude of `codespace`** considering actual requirements
- The `perspective` section is a space where we pause from the immediacy of code and computation to examine the underlying principles shaping intelligent systems

## Next Steps  
- ***FORECAST***: **Log Annual Report 2025** will be available in the next week.
- Considering improving user experience from altering article showing logic into reverse. 
- Populate the `paradox` section with content.  
- Continue refining site typography and consistency.        
- Consider extracting the footer into a shared component (`footer.html`) for consistent branding.  
- Explore using templating engines (like Jekyll) if site complexity increases.
