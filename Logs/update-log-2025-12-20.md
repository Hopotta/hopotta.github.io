# Website Maintenance Log  
**Maintainer:** Hopotta  
**Date:** December 20, 2025  
**Version:** 1.5.2  

## 1. Header Style Update  
- **From rounded rectangle to rectangle**: considering rounded one may not include areas beyond it, altered into `top: 0`.    
- Adjusted related parametres to adapt to user experience.

## 2. Articles Showing Logic Altered  
- **Improved reading experience**: formerly `article container` was sequential showing, altered into reverse.  
- More convenient to check my updated articles.  

## 3. Deleted CodeSpace Section
- **Added a `perspective` section as substitude of `codespace`** considering actual requirements
- The `perspective` section is a space where we pause from the immediacy of code and computation to examine the underlying principles shaping intelligent systems

## Next Steps  
- ***FORECAST***: **Log Annual Report 2025** will be available in the next week.
- Populate the `paradox` section with content.  
- Continue refining site typography and consistency.        
- Consider extracting the footer into a shared component (`footer.html`) for consistent branding.  
- Explore using templating engines (like Jekyll) if site complexity increases.
