# Website Maintenance Log  
**Maintainer:** Hopotta  
**Date:** May 6, 2025  
**Version:** 1.2  

## 1. Major Update: Navigation Bar Refactoring  
- **Created a reusable `header.html` component** for consistent navigation across all pages.  
- **Replaced hardcoded navigation bars** in all HTML files with a `<script>` that dynamically loads `header.html`.  
- **Improved maintainability** and reduced redundancy in multi-page structure.  
- **Introduced flexbox layout and spacing improvements** to ensure no overflow and proper margin from page edges.  
- **Tested across multiple pages**, including `index.html`, `posts/posts3.html`, and `codespace/index.html`.  

## 2. Structural and Organizational Improvements  
- **Clarified directory layout** for better scalability:  
  - `index.html`: Homepage  
  - `header.html`: Shared navigation bar component  
  - `/posts/`: Article pages (`posts1.html`â€“`posts4.html`)  
  - `/codespace/`: Project showcase pages (`index.html`, `code1.html`, etc.)  
- **Improved internal link structure** by standardizing relative paths.  

## 3. Overflow and Spacing Fixes  
- **Resolved header overflow issue** where long titles caused layout breaking.  
- **Adjusted `padding: 1rem 5rem` on header** to create equal spacing on left and right sides.  
- **Ensured responsiveness and clean spacing on mobile and desktop views.**  

## 4. Code Reusability Enhancements  
- **Adopted JavaScript-based component inclusion**, enabling modular updates.  
- **Simplified future maintenance**, where changing `header.html` updates all pages automatically.  
- Avoided needing to copy and paste navigation HTML into every `.html` page.  

## 5. Fallback Readability Protection  
- **Verified that pages still display meaningful content** even if JavaScript fails to load.  
- Consider adding `<noscript>` fallbacks in future updates.

## Next Steps  
- Conduct testing on different devices and browsers to verify the CodeSpace interface.  
- Plan for additional interactive code projects in `codespace/`.  
- Plan for designing interfaces of 'Paradox'.  
- Consider extracting the footer into a shared component (`footer.html`) for consistent branding.  
- Add `<noscript>` fallback content to warn users if dynamic navbar fails to load.  
- Explore using templating engines (like Jekyll or 11ty) if site complexity increases.
