# Website Maintenance Log
**Maintainer:** Hopotta  
**Date:** February 23, 2025  
**Version:** 1.1

## 1. Major Update: CodeSpace Page Completion  
- **Implemented and populated the `codespace/` interface.**  
- **Completed the `code1` page** with functional content.  
- **Used Minesweeper v1.0 as the primary content** for `code1.html`.  
- **Ensured navigation and layout consistency** between `codespace/` and `code1.html`.  

## 2. Navigation Bar Fixes  
- **Issue:** The "Posts" link in `codespace/code1.html` incorrectly redirected to `hopotta.github.io/posts/`.  
- **Fix:** Updated the `<nav>` link for "Posts" from `../index.html` to `/index.html`, ensuring it redirects correctly.  
- **Files Modified:**  
  - `codespace/code1.html`  

## 3. Syntax Highlighting Experiment
- **Firstly added `highlight.js`** for code syntax highlighting.  
- **Issue:** It affected font rendering, so the change was **not adopted**, and codes are not highlighted. The highlighting problem should be done in future version.

## 4. Code Formatting and UI Improvements  
- **Fixed `pre.code-snippet` font rendering issue** by enforcing `Consolas` font with `!important`.  
- **Added a language label to code blocks** using the `::before` pseudo-element.  
- **Updated Minesweeper explanation text** under `<p class="introduction">` for better readability.

## 5. Language Tag Implementation
- Implemented **language tags** for code blocks to indicate the programming language.  
- The tags are displayed in the **top-left corner** of each code block.  
- Implemented within the **`pre.code-snippet::before`** CSS rule in the styles section of the CodeSpace pages.  
- Uses the **`data-language`** attribute to dynamically assign language labels.  
- Helps improve readability and usability by clearly identifying the language of the displayed code.  


## Next Steps  
- Conduct testing on different devices and browsers to verify the CodeSpace interface.  
- Plan for additional interactive code projects in `codespace/`.
- Plan for designing interfaces of 'Paradox'
