    <h1>Critiquing Peer Review</h1>
  </header>

  <article>
    <p>
      Peer review is a cornerstone of academic publishing, designed to ensure the quality and validity of scholarly work.
      However, it is not without its flaws. Critics argue that peer review often suffers from biases, inefficiencies, and a lack of transparency.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the primary issues is bias—reviewers may have conscious or unconscious preferences that affect their evaluation.
      These biases can stem from institutional affiliations, gender, nationality, or even personal disagreements with the author.
      Such biases compromise the objectivity that peer review is supposed to uphold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, peer review can be slow and inconsistent. Many researchers experience significant delays in the review process,
      which hampers the dissemination of new knowledge. The variability in the quality of reviews—ranging from overly critical
      to excessively lenient—also undermines the credibility of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the lack of transparency in the peer-review process leaves authors in the dark about the rationale behind decisions.
      Open peer review and alternative models, such as post-publication review, have been proposed as potential solutions,
      but their adoption remains limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      While peer review is essential, addressing its shortcomings is crucial for the progress of academic research.
